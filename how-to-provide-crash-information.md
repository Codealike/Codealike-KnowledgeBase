#How to provide Visual Studio crash information

Crashes are pretty rare, because usually Visual Studio is able to detect issues and stop the loading process. 
If Visual Studio crashes, the odds are something in your configuration is wildly different to anything we have tested before. We would need your help to fix it.

If you have only Visual Studio 2010 installed. 
-Make sure you have .Net 4.5 Installed. You can run the .Net 4.5 installer and it will check for it. 

>This is the most common case of crashes and there is nothing we can do about it. Visual Studio fails to load the assemblies and crash itself.
