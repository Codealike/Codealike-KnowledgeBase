### Welcome to Codealike

We really hope you never to access any page here, but as with any other complex software it is simply not possible to test every single configuration found in the wild.

#Does Visual Studio crashes?

To rule out that Codealike is the cause: [Delete Codealike extension folder](https://github.com/Codealike/Codealike-KnowledgeBase/permanently-delete-extension.md)

If Visual Studio continue crashing then Codealike is not the reason, you should try:
[Clear Visual Studio Component Cache](https://github.com/Codealike/Codealike-KnowledgeBase/clear-visual-studio-component-cache.md)

If all fails, that's why our support team is for.
