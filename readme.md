## Welcome to Codealike

We really hope you never have to access any page here, but as with any other complex software it is simply not possible to test every single configuration found in the wild.

### Does Visual Studio crashes?

To rule out that Codealike is the cause: [Delete Codealike extension folder](https://github.com/Codealike/Codealike-KnowledgeBase/blob/master/permanently-delete-extension.md)

If Visual Studio continues crashing then Codealike is not the reason, you should try:
[Clear Visual Studio Component Cache](https://github.com/Codealike/Codealike-KnowledgeBase/blob/master/clear-visual-studio-component-cache.md)

If all else fails, that's what our support team is for.
